The error indicates two primary issues with saving data to MongoDB:

1. **`image_url` Field Type Mismatch:** Your schema defines `image_url` as a string, but the incoming data is an object containing different image URLs. You need to update the schema to correctly represent this as an object.

2. **Missing `count` Field:** The error about `count` suggests that it's missing from the data being saved, even though your schema requires it.

### Adjusting the `auchancategorySchema`

To fix the first issue, update the `image_url` field in your `auchancategorySchema` to an object, and ensure the `count` field is optional. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust your schema:

```javascript
const auchancategorySchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    id: { type: String, required: true },
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    count: { type: Number, required: false },
    children: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed, ref: "Category", default: [] }],
    description: { type: String },
    image_url: {
      svg: { type: String },
      png: { type: String },
      main_category_preview: { type: String },
    }, // Updated to match the structure of incoming data
    is_popular: { type: Boolean },
    is_collection: { type: Boolean },
    parent_id: { type: String },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

By updating the schema and ensuring all required fields are handled properly, you should resolve the issues and successfully save your category data.
